# Catching insects with raspberries

## What?

[Mike Whitehead](https://michaelrwhitehead.wordpress.com/) (mostly) and [me](http://robertlanfear.com/) (a bit) are interested in using camera traps to make observations about pollinators and other things in Australia. This repo is an attempt to keep things in order, and keep notes of how to build, set up, and use the camera traps. 

## Shopping list

Here's what you need, and at least one place you can get each thing. Prices were accurate in late 2017.

Grand total: $253.83 (excluding shipping)

Note that the Router is just to aid in setting up the camera trap in the field. You'll also need a laptop, which isn't included here. One could set these things up without a router, e.g. by programming them at home to start the camera trap when they turn on, or by using a small screen and keyboard plugged straight into the raspberry pi. In general though, it helps to have a router and a laptop, because other options make maintenance a pain.

Other things you'll need:

1. A laptop
2. A microSD card reader that connects to your laptop
3. Internet access to get things set up
4. A bit of medium-sized tupperware to make the whole thing waterproof 

## Building it



## Setting it up

#### 1. Put raspbian on the memory card
#### 2. Set up your RPi in headless mode
#### 3. Install motion-capture software
#### 4. Configure motion-capture software

## Using it in the field
